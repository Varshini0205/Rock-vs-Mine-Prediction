RESULTS
- The Logistic Regression model was trained on sonar data.
- The model achieved good accuracy on test data.
- The confusion matrix showed effective separation between Rock and Mine classes.
- The model generalizes well to unseen data.

FUTURE SCOPE
- Experiment with advanced classifiers such as SVM or Random Forest.
- Improve performance using hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model with a user-friendly interface.
- Extend the model to handle real-time sonar data.
