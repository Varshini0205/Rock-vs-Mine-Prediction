ROCK VS MINE PREDICTION USING SONAR DATA

Problem Statement:
Build a machine learning model to classify underwater objects as Rock or Mine using sonar signal data.

Dataset:
The dataset contains 60 numerical features representing sonar signal strengths at different frequencies, with labels R (Rock) and M (Mine).

Model:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
3. Evaluated using accuracy

How to Run:
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
>> streamlit run app.py
